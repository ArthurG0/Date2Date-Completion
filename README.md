# Date2Date-Completion

This Android app is designed to show progress between the two days depending on user input.

The app gets the value of a system clock, and calculates how much is left since the beginning of the first date to the second

There are 2 default options: BIRTH and TODAY. Clicking on those buttons will reset the dates to a pre-defined value

BIRTH shows the progress of my expected life
TODAY shows how much has already passed since 0:00 on a given date

Finally, clicking "COMPUTE" will output the percentage and show progress on a bar.
